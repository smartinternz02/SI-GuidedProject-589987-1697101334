Giving scores to universities can serve several important purposes. Firstly, it allows prospective students and their families to make informed decisions about where to pursue higher education based on objective criteria such as academic reputation, research output, faculty quality, and student outcomes. Secondly, it provides universities with valuable feedback on areas of strength and weakness, which can help them identify areas for improvement and enhance their overall quality. Thirdly, university rankings can also have an impact on funding and reputation, with higher-ranked institutions often receiving more research grants, attracting top talent, and enjoying greater prestige in the academic community. Overall, scoring universities can help ensure that students receive a high-quality education and that universities are held accountable for their performance.
In this project, we have some characteristics of the universities as a dataset. The target variable of this dataset is the Score. This score is predicted on the basis of the following characteristics: Quality of education, Alumni Employment, Quality of faculty, Publications, Influence, Citations, and Patents. For making a better decision about your education, you can use this web application to predict your university score. The main purpose of the Score Prediction system is to predict the score of the university based on certain parameters.
